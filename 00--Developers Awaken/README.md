![BTTF](http://i.giphy.com/1313mmmP3ETX3O.gif)

Hello Everyone!

I'm excited to get started with class and I hope you are too.

Today we want to get your laptop ready for Day 1 of the course.

Below is a list of tasks for you to do today. 

## Your Laptop

Other than your brain, the most important tool you will use is your macbook. Making sure it is properly set up is extremely important. This is the reason we do this install party. Here are some things you'll need to make sure you have.

- Macbook Air or Pro running the latest [OS X](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-el-capitan/id1018109117?mt=12)

- Clean up your machine. Those of you who have not started with a new machine, take some time to clean up your desktop and even your file system if possible.

- Make sure you always have your charging cable with you

## Install Xcode 7

You will be living in [Xcode 7](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) for 12 straight weeks. Xcode is much more than a text editor, and you will need to do more than just write code within it. You will need to get comfortable with navigating this IDE. Go ahead and sign up as an **Individual** for the Apple Developer program.

- Signup for [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/programs/)

- [Xcode 7](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)(make sure you download the latest from the Mac app store)

## Apps to Install

- Install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)

- Install [MacDown](http://macdown.uranusjr.com)

- [iTerm 2](http://iterm2.com/downloads.html) (you will want the OS 10.7+ version)

- [Atom Text Editor](https://atom.io/)

- [Dash 3 API + Docs](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dash-3-api-docs-snippets./id449589707?mt=12)

- Install the [Swift Programming Language Book](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/swift-programming-language/id881256329?mt=11) as an electronic book. Download the iBook for your Mac or iOS device to use as reference during the class.
