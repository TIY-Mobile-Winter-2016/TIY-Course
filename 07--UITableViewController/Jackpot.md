### Jackpot

Create a single view application that shows a table view as its main interface to the user. Provide a Navigation Controller to handle view transitions (we'll add these later). Add an "add" button to the navigation bar that when tapped, will generate a quick pick lottery number and place it in a cell in the table view.

Quick pick is defined as a lottery number that is randomly generated. A lottery number is 6 integers that are within the range 1 through 53. Picking a number does not preclude it from being picked again for another of the 6 in the sequence.

Create a Class called Ticket that stores the first and last name of the ticket holder as well as the actual lottery ticket. This must be a seperate class in your project.

### Objectives

* understand how to enable on-demand cell creation by the user and add them to the view
* be able to create a model class to store information and easily transport this info around the app.
* Understand custom UITableViewCells and their relation to the project.
